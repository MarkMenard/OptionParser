OptionParser
============

A simple option parser libary used in the Enable Labs Small Code workshops.

This code is based on the Ruby version of the parser libary used in 
my Small Code talks at LA Ruby Conf, Ruby on Ales,
and Rails Conf in 2014, which I was inspired to write and use by Uncle Bob's case study of an option
parser in _Clean Code_.

For an understanding of the evolution of the code see the three Small code talks
in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnxOotqZQyl49hjkNB480d6vln5VJtUyU)
on YouTube. I think the one from Ruby on Ales is the best one.
